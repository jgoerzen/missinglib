What is Missinglib?
-------------------------

It's a collection of OCaml-related utilities.  The following modules are
are provided:

ConfigParser            System for parsing configuration files
Hashtbloper             Hash table convenience operators
Hashtblutil             Hash table utilities
Lexingutil              Lexing-related utilities
Listutil                List-manipulation utilities
Slice                   Underlying API for Slice operators
Sliceoper               Flexible subparts of arrays, lists, and strings
Streamutil              Stream parser utilities
Strutil                 String-related utilities

The entire library has no prerequisites save the OCaml standard library and
findlib and is designed to install without complexity on a variety of
systems.  It could also easily be embedded within your own source trees
so that users need not have it installed beforehand.

-------------------------
Quick Start
-------------------------

1. Make sure you have OCaml 3.07 or above and findlib 0.3.1 or above
   installed.  You can obtain findlib from 
   http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

2. Run "make"

3. Optional: "make test"

4. As root: "make install"

-------------------------
Usage in programs
-------------------------

You can compile your .ml files to .cmo with this:

  ocamlfind ocamlc -package missinglib -c test.ml

  or:

  ocamlfind ocamlopt -package missinglib -c test.ml

Then, you can link them with:

   ocamlfind ocamlc -package missinglib -linkpkg -o test test.cmo

   or:

   ocamlfind ocamlopt -package missinglib -linkpkg -o test test.cmx

If you prefer to compile and link all at once, use:

   ocamlfind ocamlc -package missinglib -linkpkg -o test test.ml

   or

   ocamlfind ocamlopt -package missinglib -linkpkg -o test test.ml

In the OCaml top-level interpreter "ocaml", you can use:

   #use "topfind";;
   #require "missinglib";;

   Then continue like normal.
